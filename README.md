# api_and_json_server

An application that fetches data from the REST API. 
Packages that I used were as follows:
- JSON Server - for fake REST API,
- Dio - an HTTP client,
- JsonSerializable - for building Dart classes from JSON handling,
- Moor Flutter - for writing SQLite queries in Dart,
- Get It - as a service locator for dependency injection,
- Bloc - for managing state to separate view from business logic.
